# headphone-bluetooth-spotify
Small mac application that fixes broken bluetooth headset control by listening for events and sending them directly to apps.
This is a small mac agent application that runs in background. It is my attempt to fix the broken bluetooth headphone controls, I bought a Plantronics BackBeat Pro and they are awesome but I could not control my spotify trought my headphones. 
So when the application is running it will listen any bluetooth headphones events and dispatch it to spotify.
I decided to support the most important events such as: play/pause track and the controls to go for the next and previous track.
