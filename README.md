# headphone-bluetooth-spotify
This is a small mac agent application that runs in background. It is my attempt to fix the broken bluetooth headphone controls disptacher. I bought a Plantronics BackBeat Pro and they are awesome, but I could not control my Spotify mac client using them. 
So when the application is running it will listen any bluetooth headphones events and dispatch it to spotify.
I decided to support the most important events such as: play/pause track and the controls to go for the next and previous track. 
#Installation
<a href="https://github.com/dayvson/headphone-bluetooth-spotify/raw/master/dist/HeadphoneBluetoothSpotify.zip">Download</a> the zip extract it and move the .app file to your application folder.
I recommend you to add the application to login items so you do not need to open it.
